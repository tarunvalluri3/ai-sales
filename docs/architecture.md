# Architecture conventions

Established in Phase 0. Extend, don't restructure, in later phases unless a
prompt explicitly proposes a change here.

## Folder layout

No `src/` directory — `app/` sits at the repo root. This was already the
state of the repo when this convention was written, and `tsconfig.json`'s
`@/*` → `./*` path alias assumes it.

- `app/` — routes, layouts, route handlers (App Router).
- `lib/` — server-only shared modules (utilities, error handling, and, from
  Phase 1 on, the data-access layer and AI orchestration code). Every file in
  `lib/` that isn't safe to import into a client component starts with
  `import "server-only";`, so an accidental client import fails the build
  instead of shipping server logic into the browser bundle.
- `components/` — introduced when the first shared UI component exists.
  Not created speculatively.

## Validation

Zod is the required validation library at every runtime boundary
(`AGENTS.md` §2, §9), but it is not installed in Phase 0 — there is no
runtime boundary yet (no route handler, form, or webhook). It is added in
Phase 1, where the first request flows through a route handler.

Convention once introduced: Zod schemas are colocated with the route
handler or server action that owns the boundary they validate, not
centralized in a generic `lib/validation.ts` grab-bag. A schema shared by
more than one boundary can move to a `lib/` module named for what it
validates (e.g. `lib/schemas/lead.ts`), not a catch-all file.

## Error handling

`lib/errors.ts` defines `AppError` (a safe, user-facing message kept
separate from internal detail) and `logAndGetUserMessage` (logs the
internal detail server-side, returns only the safe message). Route
handlers and server actions should catch, log, and convert errors through
this convention rather than surfacing raw messages, stack traces, or
provider errors to the client. See `docs/security.md` §10.
